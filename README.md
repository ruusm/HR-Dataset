This repository contains the R notebook of the analysis realized on an HR Dataset. The objectives were:

- to explore the relationship between the sex and other variables like salary and special projects participation
- to explore the relationship between the race and other variables like salary and special projects participation
- to build a lineal regression model to predict salary rate based on variables like sex, employees satisfaction, 
  engagement and performance, and special projects participation
